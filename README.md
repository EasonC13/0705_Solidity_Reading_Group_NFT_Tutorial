This project demonstrates a basic NFT use case. It comes with a sample contract and a sample script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
